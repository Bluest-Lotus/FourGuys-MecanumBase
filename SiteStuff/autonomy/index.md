## Autonomy 

To move autonomously the robot using a bang-bang feed loop to move from one coordinate to the next. Within the to cursor mode the robot moves towards 

### Movement
split it into two sections
movement and pathfinding
for movement you can talk about how I used bang bang control to move from one coordinate for the next
for pathfinding you can say I used a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path to a destination, avoiding obstacles along the way

### Pathfinding
