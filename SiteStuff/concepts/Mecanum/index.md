### Hardware 

The [mecanum wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel) is the magic behind the omni directional movement of this project.

The mecanum wheel allows for passive diagonal movement when force is applied forwards from rotating the wheel. With a four wheel drive system, having mecanum wheels allows for a combination of forwards and backwards applied forces for each wheel. This applied force turns into a diagonal force from a the passive design of the wheels. The combination of all these systems allows for an easy to manipulate net force. Being able to manipulate the robot drives net force is akin to having control of the top down 2d plain of the robots position.
